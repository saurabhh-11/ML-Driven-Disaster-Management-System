# üåç ML-Driven Disaster Management System

An AI-based system to predict earthquakes and send early warnings using machine learning.

##  Key Features

-  Uses LSTM model for accurate earthquake prediction
-  Shows risk zones on a map
-  Sends real-time alerts (SMS, email, notifications)
-  Compares multiple ML models (LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

##  How It Works

1. Collects seismic data from sensors/USGS
2. Cleans and processes the data
3. Trains models to predict earthquake risk
4. Alerts users and shows risk areas on a map

##  Benefits

- High prediction accuracy
- Fast alerts improve response
- Easy to use with location preferences


##  Future Plans

- Predict other disasters (floods, tsunamis)
- Add real-time sensor integration
